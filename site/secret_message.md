# Save the Day -- use Python to decrypt a secret message!

Wonder Woman needs your help! Can you save the day by commanding a powerful Python to find the truth behind a mysterious amulet?

Get a glimpse into the popular Python programming language with this introductory lesson that assumes zero background! You’ll be led through instructions to write two programs and learn about variables and functions.

## Your journey begins…
You’ve just received an urgent page
… Wonder Woman needs your help! … 
 
You race to the office and find a package -- inside is a beautiful amulet along with a cryptic note.

Another note from Diana reads:

*This package just arrived from an unknown donor at the Smithsonian. I can sense that this amulet is indeed powerful, but cannot make sense of the note! It must give the details for a meeting place and time, and I’m counting on your skills as a world-famous code-breaker. Can you help me uncover the true meaning? 
To help you, I’ve enclosed instructions for how to command an enchanted Python that will do whatever you command.
\- Diana*

**Will you help Wonder Woman? Can you save the day?**

### Diana’s instructions are below -- follow them to reveal the truth behind the note!

First, you’ll need a way to command the enchanted Python! Luckily, my team has created something called Visual Studio Code that will allow you to do just that.

If you already have Visual Studio Code and Python setup then, you can skip ahead to the next step.
